This Portfolio showcases practical implementation of skills and ongoing self-development to deviler value.

Using .NET Framework 4.8 through .NET Core 8, with frontend work in jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular 12+, and ReactJS, I focus on writing clean code and making sure everything works smoothly from backend to frontend.

I’m currently reviewing System Analysis & Design to better understand how software projects are planned and built using the SDLC. I want to improve how I design and manage projects from start to finish.

My next goal is to get certified as an Azure Developer then Azure Solution Architect Expert so I can build better cloud-based apps. I’m working toward using cloud tools to make projects faster, more secure, and easier to scale.
